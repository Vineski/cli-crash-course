# Who Cares?

Why is all of this so important?

### POWER!

In a unix environment, each command is meant to do one and only one thing. By chaining commands and data together using piping and redirection you get more flexibility.

## Examples

### To see if a java process is running

```
jennapederson:~/workspace $ ps -ef | grep java
```

This can be useful because this command will output the process id. You could even pipe this process id to the kill command to magically kill the java process that was running.


### To see your favorite commands

You can pipe the output of history to awk, which  will scan it and print the second argument (the command) of each line to output. The output from awk gets piped into sort, which sorts it alphabetically. The sorted output is piped to uniq and prefixes the command with its count. This is then piped to the sort command again, but itâ€™s now sorted reverse numerically. Finally this is piped to head, which will display (by default) the first 10 lines of its input.

```
jennapederson:~/workspace $ history | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
3425 git
1256 cd
 930 ls
 523 vagrant
 339 less
 322 subl
 272 rm
 149 rake
 141 rvm
 134 bundle
```

### To see what's taking up so much room in your iTunes library:

The "du" command checks disk usage. We're going to check the size in kilobyte blocks for all the directories/files in a given directory.

```

jennapederson:~/workspace $ cd ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Music/
action@cli-crash-course-197957:iTunes Music $ du -k * | sort -nr | head
6508996	Home Videos
4120428	Compilations
3941588	Podcasts
1422264	Unknown Artist
920048	Bob Dylan
604792	VNV Nation
597572	Stromkern
560444	Led Zeppelin
544968	Various Artists
506908	Common Rotation
action@cli-crash-course-197957:iTunes Music $
```

## Recommendation

When stringing commands together like this, test them each individually to build up the final command.
