# Let's Get Started

## Learn By Doing

Don’t copy and paste. TYPE IT IN! Repetition is how you will learn these commands.

## A Word of Caution

One of the great benefits of the command line is that you have the power. Understand the command that you are typing before pressing enter.

Don’t worry! It’s ok to screw up. It happens to the best of us and it WILL happen. It’s always a great way to learn. We’ll talk about some tips and tricks to help prevent bad things from happening.

_Note:_ All examples here will be prefaced with “Try this now:”. We'll break for a few minutes to try this on our own. Ask questions of the TAs if you run into roadblocks.

## Open Your Terminal

- If you’re on a Mac, hit CMD+Space and type terminal. Hit enter after selecting Terminal.
- If you’re using [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/join/MommurvvT9A?utm_source=nitrous.io&utm_medium=copypaste&utm_campaign=referral), find the box you created using [these setup instructions](https://github.com/jennapederson/cli-crash-course/blob/master/setup.md). If the box is not started, click the orange Start button. When the box is started (indicated by a green circle icon), click the grey Terminal button.
- If you're on Linux/Unix, open up the console or terminal application (it is assumed you already know how to do this).

## What is a Shell?

A shell is an interface for accessing the underlying commands of an operating system.

This workshop focuses on the [Bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html) shell.

On Nitrous.io, you will already be set up to use the Bash shell.

On a Mac, you should have already looked at the setup and made sure you are using the Bash shell. If not, go there now.
