# Setup

Below are the instructions for getting setup for Donâ€™t Let the CLI Scare You: A Command Line Crash Course. Please be sure to complete these BEFORE attending the workshop. If you have questions or issues, please reach out.

## Linux/Unix/OS X

You're good to go!

## Windows or Chromebook

You have a couple of options.

### Use Nitrous.io (RECOMMENDED)

[Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/join/MommurvvT9A?utm_source=nitrous.io&utm_medium=copypaste&utm_campaign=referral) is an excellent way to "code in the cloud". It lets you quickly spin up a "box" with your favorite development environment already installed and lets you share it with others. This approach is done right in your browser. This is FREE unless you want extra options, space, etc, which you will not need for this workshop.

1. Go to [https://www.nitrous.io/join/MommurvvT9A?utm_source=nitrous.io&utm_medium=copypaste&utm_campaign=referral] and create an account if you don't already have one or just sign in
1. After signing in, go to the dashboard (a list of your Boxes) by clicking the green button for the Dashboard or the Boxes link in the top menu
1. Click the orange New Box button
1. Select the Node.js template (we will not be using Node.js but this template will give us access to the CLI tools for this workshop)
1. Give the box a name (or use the silly one that Nitrous generates)
1. Leave the other settings at their default
1. Click the orange Create Box button
1. Nitrous will create the box and start it up for you (this is known as provisioning)
1. You're done when you get here:

### Install Cygwin (LAST RESORT)

If you want to run these commands on your Windows computer, you can also use Cygwin, a tool that lets you use the GNU and Open Source tools in a Windows environment in a way that is similar to Linux.

1. Download [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html)
1. Run the downloaded exe file by double-clicking on it
1. Use the default installation options
1. When prompted to Choose a Download Site, select one in the U.S. (closer to you the quicker it will download)
1. Continue through the installation with the default options
